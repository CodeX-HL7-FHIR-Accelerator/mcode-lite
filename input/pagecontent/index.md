### Background

**Insert introduction on the use of mCODE elements for public cancer data use. Reference different initiatives like CMS EOM and USCDI+ Cancer. Reference other research-related use case needs for public cancer data such as pragmatic clinical trials**.


A summary mapping of the actionable and minimal mCODE-lite elements are shown below:

**Replace with markdown table of mappings from HDR excel to data element name updated with the mCODE STU3 update**

### Scope

Data element prioritization was based on current health initiatives across federal agencies. These include but are not limited to the following efforts currently in development:
* Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM) Clinical Data ELements Guide, version 2.0 (January 2024)
* USCDI+ Cancer
* etc. (add more as identified)

### Approach

Mostly narrative with hyperlinks to mCODE and other supporting IGs (e.g.: US Core). Profiles only created if needed (TBD on whether we need to bring in mCODE STU3 as a dependency).
