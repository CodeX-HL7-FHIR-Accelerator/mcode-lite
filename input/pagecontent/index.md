### Background

**Insert introduction on the use of mCODE elements for public cancer data use. Reference different initiatives like CMS EOM and USCDI+ Cancer. Reference other research-related use case needs for public cancer data such as pragmatic clinical trials**.


A summary mapping of the actionable and minimal mCODE-lite elements are shown below:

**Replace with markdown table of mappings from HDR excel to data element name updated with the mCODE STU3 update**

### Scope

* Mappings were based on the EOM Clinical Data ELements Guide, version 1.0, released on June 1, 2023.



### Approach

Mostly narrative with hyperlinks to mCODE and other supporting IGs (e.g.: US Core). Profiles only created if needed (TBD on whether we need to bring in mCODE STU3 as a dependency).


### Credits

Our thanks to the contributors to the organizations which drive the guidance in this IG:
* Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
